================== Snake =================

This is a web version of the classic game Snake. Technologies used in this
project are:

Technologies used:

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Closure Library (http://code.google.com/p/closure-library/downloads/list)
- Closure Compiler (http://closure-compiler.appspot.com)

Setup
1. Download the closure library and include the closure-library/ folder in
   the top level directory of the project.
2. Open up snake.html. You can reference the uncompiled JavaScript or the
   compiled version.

When making changes to the code, be sure to compile the changes using  
the Closure Compiler with the Closure Library URL, and using "Advanced"
optimizations. The game should run against the compiled version of the
JavaScript.
